**Abstract**:Our team answered IBM 2021 call for code aiming to reduce the risk of agricultural production and achieve ‘zero hunger’ by new technology and innovative financial instrument. We developed a new system named after ancient Greek goddess of the harvest, i.e. Demeter. We hope our ‘Demeter’ can save the living of the small-scale farmers so that no children die of hunger anymore.
