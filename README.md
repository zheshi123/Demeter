## Short-description:

### What's the problem?

Over 1 billion people in the developing countries are suffering from poverty, with a substantial majority of them living in rural areas. The development of agriculture can play a direct role in rural poverty alleviation. However, during the last several decades, there has been an increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as prolonged drought, floods, severe storms, heat waves, and untimely freezes which can have severe detrimental effects on crop yield, and therefore, agricultural production.

### How can technology help?

Hot-New technology makes the small-scale farmers more resistant to the extreme weather. 

### The idea

Our team answered IBM 2021 call for code aiming to reduce the risk of agricultural production and achieve ‘zero hunger’ by new technology and innovative financial instrument. We developed a new system named after ancient Greek goddess of the harvest, i.e. Demeter. We hope our ‘Demeter’ can save the living of the small-scale farmers so that no children die of hunger anymore.
